### 69. Sqrt(x)

---

**Easy**

Given a non-negative integer x, compute and return the square root of x.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are **truncated**, and only **the integer part** of the result is returned.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: x = 4
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: x = 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.
```

**Constraints:**

- 0 <= x <= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1
